     * The following line declares a variable called result and assigns it the value of the sum of num1 and num2.

    int result = sum(num1, num2);

    /*
     * The following line prints the result of the sum function to the console.
     * The format specifier %d is used to print an integer value.
     */
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is: %d\n", num1, num2, result);

    return 0;
}

#include "dummy.h"

    /*
     * The following if statement checks if both a and b are greater than 0.
     * If they are, the function returns the sum of a and b.
     * If they are not, the function returns 0.

    }
}
